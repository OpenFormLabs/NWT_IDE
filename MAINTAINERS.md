# Maintainers - Open Form Labs

This document outlines the maintenance policy and the individuals responsible for the NWT IDE.

## Current Maintainers
* **NVSProgrammer** - Lead Architect & Repository Owner.

## Maintenance Philosophy
1. NWT IDE should remain 100% free and open-source. As a development tool, it is a foundational utility that must remain accessible to everyone without barriers.
2. No bloat or forcing users to accept changes, if not naturally required for the functionality of other things.
3. No vibe-coding, because it is a complex project that will be used to build others.

## Development Environment
* **OS:** [![Linux Mint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux%20Mint-87cf3e?logo=linux&logoColor=white)](https://linuxmint.com/)
* **Engine:** [![Godot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-478CBF?logo=godot-engine&logoColor=white)](https://godotengine.org/)

> * For other OS, there are files that need to be added or edited, if there is no existing tested version.
> * :warning: **DO NOT USE ABSOLUTE PATHS!**
