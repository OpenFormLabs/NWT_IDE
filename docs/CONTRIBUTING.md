## Requirements to Merge to **Protected Branches**(main, dev/*)
 ### **Human-in-the-Loop!**
  You must understand the code you are merging with the **Protected Branches**.<br>
  Do not trust AI for the whole code.<br>
  You can use AI as a tool to help you understand the code or fix an issue, or do repetitive tasks (**TEST IT EVERYTIME**).<br>
  It is better to understand it and make it your way!<br>
  **BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU COMMIT!** 

 ### **No things that no one asked for or wanted, that cannot be easily disabled!**
  The IDE should not push things that others do not asked or want.

 ### **No Proprietary or Paid Dependencies!**
  The IDE should be **COMPLETELY FREE!**<br>

 ### Ensure it is functional!
  Every part should be functional, not just a bloat to take up space.
  If you are committing to the **Protected Main Branch**, it should be fully functional.

 ### Make a Pull Request!
  The **Main Branches** are protected.
